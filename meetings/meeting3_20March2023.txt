Meeting 3 for Snakey: The Game (20 March 2023, 6.30pm SAST)
===========================================================

Attendees: Raaga Krishna, Palesa, Jesse



db:
- id 
- username 
- score 

remote db
- we can have a setup sql script (Willa)

Leaderboard class (Palesa)
- string int hashmap 
- add score method with user 
- just like the-hive


username
- should it be unique... (Palesa) 
- when will the user give their username? At start of game or end? 
- Willa: prompt user to make a new username if the username is taken 
		 every score has a unique username 
		 but we could say: user can have same username 

movement class (Willa) 
- Swing instance... 


Questions:

1. How do we indicate the snake's head? 
	when playing the game, the head will be clear 
	the snake is always moving.. 
	
	each cell, when we render it, each cell will not just be 1 pixel 
	but it will be a few pixel in each one 
	head can be a visual head and it takes up more and more cells 

2. How we do show which way the snake has grown? 
	it will make sense 
	every tick of snake
	if you eat, the tail will stay in same spot and head will move forward 

3. Do we need a "You won"? We can show the points you got after you die, because at a point, you will have no space to move around you..
	we can code it 

4. Does the snake grow immediately after eating? 
	answered in 2 

5. The snake starts with the length of 1, agree? 
	yes
