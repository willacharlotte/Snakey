Meeting 4 for Snakey: The Game (21 March 2023, 6.30pm SAST)
===========================================================

Attendees: Raaga Krishna, Palesa, Willa, Jesse 

Same page of the game mechanics (Willa) 
- Snake game on Google 

TimeController (Willa) 
- uses scheduled executor 
- runs a task, every x number of seconds 
- lambdas used a lot in functional interfaces 

when snake moves: (Willa) 
1. moveSnake (returns a Cell) 
2. then check if it moved into a valid pos (inside board or into itself) 
	if SNAKE, then ends game 
	if FOOD, then does a special action: the doSpecial does this 
	if not in list, ends game 
	if NONE, then it just moves (move head to that pos) 
	
- in array, just push the currIndex 
	shift array 
	
	
Snake: (Raaga) 
- addLength
- addScore 
- decrementLength 
- decrementScore 
- moveSnake takes in no parameters 


Removes all changes in the git branch: 
- git restore . 


TimeController can add a new food 
- rename to GameController (Jesse) 


Order of to-do: 
1. add setDirection --> done 
2. Willa ... 
3. add dir to snake class 
4. move snake

Sound (Willa) 
- could be freeware 
- might not do it myself 


Capital w for keyListener? Yes (Willa) 
- listens for key code ;-)
	acts independently of the shift
